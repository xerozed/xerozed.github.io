    <div class="project-text">
Although the global pandemic was not a positive event in human history, it produced numerous large and valuable datasets. For many aspiring data analysts,
(including myself) this created an opportunity to practice real-world analysis on rich and complex data source.<br>
In this project, I use the dataset available at https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths to explore several questions with SQL,
and then visualize the key insights in a Tableau dashboard.<br>
My goal was to build analytical skills while creating meaningful summaries of the pandemic data.

<div class="project-subtitle">Project Questions</div>
<div class="project-text">
    <ul>
<li>How severe was COVID-19 in terms of global cases and death percentage?</li>
<li>Which countries experienced the highest infection levels relative to their population size?</li>
<li>What global patterns can be observed in the death count breakdown by continent?</li>
<li>How did the infection rate relative to population size change over time?</li>
